# redditchecker
This bot checks a subreddit for new posts. It was an exercise in learning how to work with asynchronous loops and OAuth2 authentication with Reddit's API. I intentionally did not use the PRAW python module because I was only scraping for one thing, and because I wanted to learn how to get the data on my own. 

Use by creating Reddit and Discord bots/applications and get the authentication details, which will be placed in the config.ini file. Required Discord permissions are: see channels, send messages, embed links.
